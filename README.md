## Description

HoneyEngine is a game engine created for our class "Game Engines" in our Video Game Design and Development Degree in CITM (UPC).
It is a simple 3D geometry viewer that supports different features like loading fbx models, adding textures, and managing these game objects.

Thank you to Alex Ávila and Bosco Barber for letting us use their Ko-Fi Engine as a base for the last delivery. :)
